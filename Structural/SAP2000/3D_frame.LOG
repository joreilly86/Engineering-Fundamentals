 ---------------------------------
 BASIC STABILITY CHECK FOR LINEAR LOAD CASES:
    NUMBER OF NEGATIVE STIFFNESS EIGENVALUES SHOULD BE ZERO FOR STABILITY.
    (NOTE: FURTHER CHECKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS DEEMED NECESSARY,
     SUCH AS REVIEWING EIGEN MODES FOR MECHANISMS AND RIGID-BODY MOTION)

    NUMBER OF NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES         =           0,  OK.
