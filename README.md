# Python for Engineering Examples

Welcome to the official repository for Python scripts and examples supporting the Flocode Engineering Insights newsletter available at [flocode.substack.com](https://flocode.substack.com). This repository contains a collection of Python examples across various engineering disciplines such as structural, civil, hydraulic, geotechnical, and mechanical engineering. Each folder in this repository corresponds to specific disciplines and contains relevant Python scripts that demonstrate practical applications in each field.

## Repository Structure

Each folder within the repository is dedicated to a different branch of engineering:

- `Structural/` - Examples related to structural engineering, such as beam load calculations and material stress analysis, some FE tools.
- `Civil/` - Scripts that deal with civil engineeringm, this could be anything.
- `Hydraulic/` - Hydraulic engineering examples, including water flow simulations and pump systems.
- `Geotechnical/` - Python scripts for geotechnical applications such as soil stability and foundation design.
- `Mechanical/` - Mechanical engineering scripts focusing on dynamics, thermodynamics, and mechanical systems.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you should have a basic understanding of Python and the necessary libraries often used in scientific and engineering computations such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. 
Mostly these examples are for you to play around with in conjunction with the [newsletter articles](https://flocode.substack.com/).

## Periodic Updates

This repository is updated periodically to reflect the latest insights and examples discussed in the Flocode Engineering Insights newsletter. Keep an eye on the repository and newsletter for updates.
